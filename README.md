## What's included

There are two top-level directories; `data` and `images`.

### data

The `data` folder contains all D2e data; advanced-quests, allies, classes, conditions, familiars, heroes, monsters, lieutenants, items, overlord-decks, etc.

### images

The `images` folder contains images for each of the above data cards.

## Usage

You can use this data to build your own apps, etc.

The easiest way to do this is via [Bower](http://bower.io/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d2e) or as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules#Starting-with-Submodules):
